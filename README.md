How to play
=

· Enter your nickname
· Select move types from given list (type only 1 or 2 or 3)
· After all movements are selected, moves and attacks will be made, HP points will be displayed on the screen.
· The game will continue until any of the life points reaches zero.
· There is no way to end the game with a negative score. If the player's and computer's hit points fall below zero at the same time, they will both be considered zero.
· Life points reduced from the opponent plus your own life points determine the score.

Good Luck...
